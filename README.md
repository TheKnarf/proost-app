# Proost

Proost syncs data from Google Calendar (events and event attendees) to a MySQL database.

Proost is freshly open-sourced. There's no README to speak of yet, but hit us up
in [Issues](https://github.com/belvinlabs/proost-app/issues) if you'd like to
try it out or get involved in the project. We'll happily help you!
